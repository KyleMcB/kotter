/**
 * A thread-safe collection of key/value pairs, where additionally each key is typed and tied to a [Lifecycle].
 *
 * You register values against a typed [Key] object. When registering them, an optional dispose block can be specified
 * as well, which will automatically be triggered whenever the key is removed (either manually or because its lifecycle
 * ended).
 *
 * You must call [start] with a [Lifecycle] first before keys tied to it can be added. Afterwards, call [stop] to remove
 * all keys with the matching lifecycle.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * // Globals somewhere
 * object MyLifecycle : ConcurrentScopedData.Lifecycle
 * val MyKey = MyLifecycle.createKey<Boolean>()
 *
 * // Later...
 * data = ConcurrentScopedData()
 * data.start(MyLifecycle)
 * data[MyKey] = true
 * ...
 * data.stop(MyLifecycle) // MyKey is removed
 * ```
 *
 * Note: Although the class is designed to be thread safe, some calls (which are noted with warnings) can expose values
 * to you which are no longer covered by the lock. Those should only be used to fetch immutable or thread-safe values.

     * class Application {
     *    object Lifecycle : ConcurrentScopedData.Lifecycle
