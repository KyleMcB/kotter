// NOTE: If this test seems sparse for such potentially delicate code, it's because the general usage of the lock class
// is already tested by the rest of the tests indirectly. However, as for now (this may change later), this class exists
// to test really gnarly edge cases I want to make sure are working

        // and if the lock implementation for promoting a read lock to a write lock is bad, we can end up with a
        // deadlock, as both blocks wait for the read count to go to 0 before acquiring the lock. The way the lock class
        // actually works is anytime a write is requested, all reads are temporarily released (only to be reacquired
        // after the write is done). In this way, between the two threads, one of them will be ready to write when both
        // locks have released all reads.
        //
        // After the first thread finishes its write, it will then be back in read mode, just for a moment before it
        // releases it. And then the second thread will finally get a go.
