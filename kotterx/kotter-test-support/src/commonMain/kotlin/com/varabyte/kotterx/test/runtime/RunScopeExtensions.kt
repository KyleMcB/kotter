/**
 * Block the current run block until a render has occurred where the passed in [condition] is true.
 *
 * This can be useful to do because, due to the threading nature of Kotter (e.g. one thread gets notified, which
 * notifies another, which causes a render to happen on a third), occasionally it's not possible to predict if logic
 * will all execute in one pass or multiple passes. In that case, if you at least know that renders will eventually
 * settle on some consistent output, you can use this method to wait for that.
 *
 * A very useful pattern is to test the terminal's state:
 *
 * ```
 * testSession { terminal ->
 *   section { ... }.run {
 *     // do some stuff and then...
 *     blockUntilRenderWhen {
 *       terminal.resolveRerenders() == listOf(
 *         "expected line 1",
 *         "expected line 2",
 *         "",
 *       )
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param timeout A timeout to set for this block before it throws a [TimeoutCancellationException]. If null, this
 *   defaults to a 1 second. The thought here is that we're never waiting for some 10 second real-time animation to
 *   finish, but rather we're waiting for the Kotter engine to resolve its current event loop, which should barely take
 *   milliseconds. You can pass in [Duration.INFINITE] if you want to disable this.

 *
 * This method will print out a helpful error message if the render doesn't match at the time of the timeout running
 * out.
